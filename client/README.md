# Design

### I chose to create a Node (Typescript) app to serve a React (Typescript) frontend.  I wanted to illustrate that I am comfortable writing JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.

### I took a TDD approach to building the FizzBuzz logic on the Node side.  Afterwards, I created the Node endpoint and then the React client app.


# How to Run

### install client and server npm dependencies
### `npm run installAll` (from root folder)

### build client and start express server
### `npm start` from root folder

# How to Run Node/Server Unit Tests

### `npm test` (from root folder)

# Minor Bug
### I do want to make known there is a small bug in the application.  If you try to enter an array such as this `[1,2,a]`, the current parsing does not let the user get results for the first two elements.  However, if you enter `[1,2,"a"]` the application will return results for all entries.

# Thank you!
### I enjoyed the coding exercise.  I hope this code sample give an small preview as to what I can do.  In addition, I am very good at explaining technical concepts to technical and non-technical folks.  I have a high level of patience and work well on teams.
